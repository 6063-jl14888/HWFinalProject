Instrument

This instrument can be played using seven buttons, each representing a different musical note. When a note is played, a corresponding indicator light will illuminate. Simultaneously, seven graphics on the screen represent the seven notes. Depending on the button pressed, a clicking animation will appear in the row corresponding to the pressed note, accompanied by ripple-like waves at the bottom of the screen, resembling sound waves. Additionally, users can also play the instrument by clicking on the graphics displayed on the screen.

Shadow Hands

Using the computer's camera to recognize our hands, this interactive game displays random images on the screen. Players must replicate the shapes shown by making corresponding hand gestures. During this process, various shapes will fall from the top of the screen, and players need to press the corresponding buttons when these shapes reach a baseline at the bottom. Only by successfully completing the gesture can players proceed to the next challenge. (Suitable for two players)

Text-based Game

In this game, only text appears on the screen, specifying tasks for the player, such as turning on a red light bulb or finding all the letter "O"s. Subsequently, players need to complete these tasks by performing actions like moving, clicking, or dragging on the screen or breadboard. Throughout the process, there may be some simple dialogues, like "Why not try moving something?" or "Can't find it, huh? Hahaha," adding a playful element to the game.
